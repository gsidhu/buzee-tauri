On first creation,
	Add metadata of all files

On all followup rounds / sync,
	Parse metadata of all files but only update the ones whose time metadata or size has changed
	Then run through all the files and remove the ones that no longer exist
	Then start parsing the content of all files and add it to the body table
		If file doesn't exist in body table, add the content
		If file exists, check if the last_synced time is older than the file's last modified time
			If it is, update the content
		Then update the last_synced time to the current time
